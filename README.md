# Qtile

* This is my repo for my Qtile setup. It has my config.py, my autostart.sh, picom.conf as well as my sxhkdrc file
* Please note that you will need to install the qtile-extras package as well as the python-dbus-next package for everything to work correctly.

# Autostart & Picom

* You will want to place the autostart.sh and picom.conf files in a directory titled 'scripts' within the Qtile directory

# Sxhkd

* You will also want to place the sxhkdrc file in a directory titled 'sxhkd' within the Qtile directory
